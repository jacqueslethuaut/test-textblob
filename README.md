# test-textblob

Clean dataset using TextBlob library

The idea is to clean the Gender column of the DataSet

Using the spell checker then the TextBlob librairies

Always understand your data. Don't trust librairies ^^

The dataset is free from Kaggle, just some modifications for the purpose of this PoC
If any issue, please let me know
